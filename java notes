#18 nested if statements
nested statements are conditional structures that checks if a condition is true then performs the required function.
if (age < 50){
system.out.println("you are old");
else {
system.out.println("you are not yet old")
}
}

#19 else if
this statements is used to give java several options to choose from
if (age > 60)
system.out.println("you are a senior citizen")
else if (age >= 50)
	system.out.println("you are in your 50's")
else system.out.println("you are young")

#20 conditional operators.
this is short way to represent the if else. ussually it fits in a straight line.
system.out.println (age>50 ? "you are old": "you are young")

#22 for loops.
this is an iteration function that allows a function to iterate throug the condition specified.
for (int counter=1, counter<10; counter++);
	system.out.println("counter")

#24 do whâ€Žile loop
it executes the body before checking the test condition 
do {
	system.out.println(counter);

}while (counter <= 10);

#25 math class
this class allowsus to use the different mathematical functionalities
Math.abs() stands for absolute value. it takes any number and gives it the absolute value.
Math.ceil() stands for ceiling and rounds up any value.
Math.floor () rounds down the number
Math.Max () gives the maximum number between two numbers.
Math.min () gives the minimum number between the two numbers.
Math.pow () gives the power of number.
Math.sqrt() it finds the square root of number

#26 Random number generator
we inmport the random class 
import jav.util.Random

#27 arrays
array is a collection of similar variable  grouped together.
int variable[]= new int [10];
