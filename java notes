#18 nested if statements
nested statements are conditional structures that checks if a condition is true then performs the required function.
if (age < 50){
system.out.println("you are old");
else {
system.out.println("you are not yet old")
}
}

#19 else if
this statements is used to give java several options to choose from
if (age > 60)
system.out.println("you are a senior citizen")
else if (age >= 50)
	system.out.println("you are in your 50's")
else system.out.println("you are young")

#20 conditional operators.
this is short way to represent the if else. ussually it fits in a straight line.
system.out.println (age>50 ? "you are old": "you are young")
